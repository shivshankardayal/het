			Quickly, quickly, quickly now. Run you fools!!! Why? Because <strong>time</strong>
			is of essence.Why time is of essence? Short answer because you cannot create
			it easily. Long answer is below. Read with care.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			In economics, we talk in terms of <strong>ROI</strong>(return on investment).
			Economists do a brutal reduction of investment in terms of money which is
			outrageous. Investment is natural resources along with time and energy of
			an individual. Natural resources are recyclable. However, time is a nasty
			one as it depends on your speed. The faster you move the slower it passes
			for you. Now we cannot really move fast enough to slow time enough and
			that we have one life-time making this resource finite in nature. Going
			back in past raises several questions and we simply cannot go in
			future(it would be pointless in any case).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			So by logical deduction we can say that time is most important resource.
			Therefore, life demands haste. But do not be too hasty. Why, because
			you will have collisions if you go too fast. Let us get started.

		    <h2>Zero or Lies</h2>
		    <p>
			We start with simplest of numbers which is unique, zero or \(0\). What
			is zero? It has two things. One is concept and second is a symbol. The
			symbol is \(0\) and the concept is falsity or non-existence. Null, nil,
			void is what is zero. Let me present with you an example. If I say that
			where you are there is an alive dinosaur present which would be a lie.
			The fact is that there are zero dinosaurs where you are is how the concept
			goes. Since my statement is false and since dinosaurs do not exist
			the concept is about falsity or non-existence.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Now you would say that if this was so easy then why Vivekananda gave
			such a long speech in Chicago. Well, I have not read what he talked
			about because I think that I am alone in this universe and then try
			to understand zero. So no more humans mean that there are zero humans.
			If the concept is so simple then why it eludes us. Zero does not.
			Since we use it for many more things as you will soon see the simplicity
			is hidden. Patience young one. In due course of time all will be clear.
