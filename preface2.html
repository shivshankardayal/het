		<h2>Tools Used to Write This Book</h2>
		<p>
		    This entire book has been typed using raw HTML5 technologies.
		    I have used <code>Emacs</code> with <code>web-mode</code>.
		    Material design has been used and I do not force a font on
		    users except for headings. You can set default font in your
		    browser and if you do not set then it will be rendered mostly
		    in a <code>serif</code> font.
		</p>
		<p>
		    For rendering Mathematics, I have used MathJax. Since pages
		    are small it does not really matter as very little math will
		    be present on single page. I have tried to keep the
		    UI sane and responsive in nature. But the problem is when
		    I edit the pages they do cros <code>A4</code> paper size.
		    Keeping it in <code>HTML</code> is important as it can be
		    scanned and indexed by a search-engine. That is why I will
		    not prepare an index as that would be a herculean task.
		</p>
		<p>
		    For preparing images I have mostly used raw <code>SVG</code>,
		    which are hand-coded. For some images I have used POV-Ray, which
		    is a rayracer program.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Great folks of Mozilla have written great documentation on <code>HTML5,
			CSS3, SVG</code> along with Math authoring. For now bear the MathJax
		    version. Eventually, I will run all this through <code>phantomjs</code>
		    and render all math server side making the load blazing fast.
		</p>
		<p>
		    You would ask me what about index. This book will have no index.
		    I rely on search engines to generate that.
		</p>
		<p>
		    There is one more reason to use raw HTML5, CSS3 and SVG is that
		    frameworks come and go. Also, I wanted to learn these technologies
		    in depth. So you see it is kind of selfish.

		    I did use <code>Sphinx</code> documentation tool but recently
		    with version 1.7.0 release several plugins broke. Then, I realized
		    why Knuth froze his typesetting engine <code>τεχ</code> in the
		    sense that new features are not allowed.

		<p>
		    To all those who tried to do good things by helping others.
		    Namely, Richard M. Stallman, Donald Knuth etc. I will fill this
		    later.
