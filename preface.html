			You do not judge a book by its cover. If you are a regular visitor then you
			would know that I ran <a href="#">libreprogramming.org</a> and <a href="#">10hash.com</a>.
			You would also know that I never liked SOPA or PIPA and the way in the name
			of legal and copyright issues books and knowledge is being hoarded.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			I am a voracious reader and writer. I read a lot and write a lot. After reading a lot of books
			and trying to teach quite a few students I started writing a C Book which is almost complete
			but will never complete. To write a book I learned several typesetting systems like
			Groff, LaTeX, Docbook, Sphinx etc but was never satisfied by results. I had also decided
			that I will write books on math while I struggled to explain complexity algorithms as
			I could not make assumptions. Now this led to huge burden of writing several books.
			Therefore, I decided to write one book which will answer all questions. Please have
			patience and in due course of time it will be all clear.

		    <h2>Why I wrote this book?</h2>
		    <p>
			So that no one should experience this pain which I have experienced while teaching
			young students. This book is more like notes to me.
		    </p>
		</section>
		<section>
		    <h2>Who should read this book?</h2>
		    <p>
			Anyone can read first chapter about <code>basics</code> but things get quite
			complicated after that fast. Although, it is written for someone like \(10\)
			years old but you will find that the material is quite complex in nature. It
			is not for the faint-hearted one. So steel your heart before proceeding.
		    </p>
		</section>
		<section>
		    <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
		    <p>
			Class \(5\) education is expected. The more you know the more you need to
			read. Access to a computer running GNU/Linux with internet access is
			needed. Basic familiarity with executing commands is also assumed.
