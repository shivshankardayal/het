		<h2>Prefix and Postfix Notataions</h2>
		<p>
		    <b>Prefix notation</b>, also known as <b>normal Polish notation (NPN), Łukasiewicz notation,
			Warsaw notation, Polish prefix notation</b> or simply <b>Polish notation(PN)</b> was
		    invented by Polish logician Jan Łukasiewicz. You can read about him at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_%C5%81ukasiewicz">
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_%C5%81ukasiewicz</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		    <img src="img/Jan_Łukasiewicz.jpg" class="fr"/> Due to nature of prefix notation it does not
		    need parenthesis as infix does(it will become clear soon). It is used heavily in <code>LISP</code>
		    family of languages(this will take time). <code>Scheme</code> language which you have just
		    used also belongs to same family of languages. It is not of much importance for us
		    now except the fact that it will be used on <code>GNU Guile</code> prompt for
		    calculations and verifying our calculations. The only point worth noting is that
		    prefix notation can be easily and readily reduced to <i>abstract syntax </i> trees.
		    I can give a link as to what it is but for now hold your curiosity a bit.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Anology can be drawn and prefix notation led to postfix notation. It is also known as
		    <strong>Reverse Polish notation (RPN)</strong>. As I have already told in this notation
		    operator comes after both the operands. It was invented by Arthur Burks, Don Warren
		    and Jesse Wright in 1954. Practcally it was used in
		    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-35">HP-25</a>	calculators and many other
		    places. In programming it was used in <i>stack</i> based programming languages like
		    <i>Postscript</i>.

		    We have strayed from our main topic of addition quite a bit so let us get
		    back to it.

		<h3>Observations</h3>
		<p>
		    The most important observation is order of appearance of operands does
		    not have effect on final value. This is known as <i><strong>commutative
		    property</strong></i> of addition.
		</p>
		<p style="color:red">
		    <i><strong>Note that it does not always hold true though it will a long while
			before I can show you.</strong></i>
		</p>
		<p>
		    The second observation is that adding zero to any number is not of any use
		    as it does not change the number at all. Also, adding one increases value
		    to next number and adding two increases the value to next-next number.
		</p>

		<p>
		    There are other properties of addition but all in due course of time.
		    Patience is virtue.
